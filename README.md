## This is Hephia

## This is a Personal project Called Hephia V2

This is the second version, the first is not on Github and will never be released

My attempt with this work is to keep better track of this insane project I'm getting into and to log what my Discord Bot can do here as it gets updated with time.

This will also be with the goal of teaching me more about Github and getting used to it's environment.

Hephia V2 uses a MongoDB database and is meant to be self hosted
